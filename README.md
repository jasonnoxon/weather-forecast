## Weather Forecast

A [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) app that, currently, gets the 7 day forecast for a location. What's nice is that, by using the [apiux.com](https://www.apixu.com) weather API, the user can enter a named location, or a zip/postal-code.

## To Do

I'd like to make it prettier (I am using [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com), which does a fine job -- the app just needs some fine tuning), and also I will allow the user to select 5, 7, or any number of days, really.
